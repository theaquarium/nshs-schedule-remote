                <h3>Do we use cookies?</h3>
                <p>
                    Yes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service
                    provider transfers to your computer's hard drive through
                    your web browser (if you allow) that enables the site's or
                    service provider's systems to recognize your browser and
                    capture and remember certain information.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We use cookies to compile aggregate data about site traffic
                    and site interactions in order to offer better site
                    experiences in the future. We may also use trusted third
                    party services that track this information on our behalf.

                <h3>Analytics</h3>
                <p>
                    This site uses Google Analytics to compile basic usage data
                    about user count and page statistics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Google Analytics is a web analytics service offered by
                    Google that tracks and reports website traffic. Google uses
                    the data collected to track and monitor the use of this
                    site.
                    <br />
                    You can opt-out of having made your activity on the site
                    available to Google Analytics by installing the Google
                    Analytics opt-out browser add-on. The add-on prevents the
                    Google Analytics JavaScript (ga.js, analytics.js, and dc.js)
                    from sharing information with Google Analytics about visits
                    activity. For more information on the privacy practices of
